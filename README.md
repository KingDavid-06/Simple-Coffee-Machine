- This project is called a Simple Coffee Machine on python OOP. A coffee machine that prompts users to select the flavor of coffee they want to purchase. Three distinct hot flavors are available in our coffee machine such as Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino. Also they can input a money to buy a coffee. Once the resources is already empty the terminal will be close.

## How the Program Works:
- The code in the program start by asking or choosing in either REPORT, OFF, or 1 of the three Available Coffe in a machine.
- If the user pick REPORT, the user will be able to see the available resources.
- If the user pick OFF, the program will be terminated and print "Thank you! Come again".
- If the user pick either one of the coffee, "Latte, Espresso, Cappuccino", the program will ask a user for payments, once the payment is done successfully the machine will give the coffee.
- And when the resources is run out of stuck the program will be terminated.
